# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

# .Python

Using `{.python}`: this is not-executable code, just useful for showing code with color.

Direct code:
```{.python}
print('Hola mundo!')
```

From file:
```{.python}
{{< include test.py >}}
```

# Python

Using `{python}`: this is useful to executing code when rendering the book. You can control how to show the code and outputs. 

Direct code:
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
print('Hola mundo!')
```

From file:
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
{{< include test.py >}}
```



# Pyodide

Pyodide-enabled code cell, using `{pyodide-python}`: This allows for completely executable code - the user can modify the code and execute it!

Direct code:
```{pyodide-python}
print('Hola mundo!')
```

From file:
```{pyodide-python}
{{< include test.py >}}
```
